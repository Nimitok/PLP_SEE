# 🧮 Simple Python Calculator

A beginner-friendly command-line calculator built with Python.  
This tool allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations: **addition**, **subtraction**, **multiplication**, and **division** — with built-in input validation and an exit option.


## ✅ Features

- Perform basic arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- Handles invalid number inputs gracefully
- Prevents division by zero errors
- Loops until the user chooses to exit
- Easy to run via command line


## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Open a terminal (or Git Bash).
3. Navigate to the folder containing `calculator.py`
4. Run the script:

```bash
python calculator.py
````



## 💡 Sample Interaction
